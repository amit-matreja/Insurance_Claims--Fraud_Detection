The term insurance fraud refers to the commission of any act with the intent to obtain an outcome that is favorable, but fraudulent during an insurance claim. Insurance fraud may entail a person filing a false insurance claim altogether, or exaggerating their damages, injuries or other losses in order to receive benefits.
